    <h1>ABOUT JO JOBS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Jo runs a small recruitment agency and the company’s website is used to list available jobs.</p>
    <p> Applicants can view the available jobs and apply for jobs they are interested in.</p>
    <p> The website was developed several years ago by Jo’s cousin but is now a little outdated and contains bugs that need fixing.</p>
